      <p>Hi, my name is John Gansallo. I am currently a junior and a computer science 
          major. My career interests lie in the tech industry. I want to get into 
          self-driving car technology, data science, and Full-Stack Developing. I am apart 
          of and an E-board member of the Code: Black organization at the University of Maryland. 
          It is a student organization that promotes community action and diversity and wants 
          the underrepresented to succeed not only while attending school but after well after 
          graduation as well. I am also on the UMD Club Soccer Team </p>
      <p>In high school, I saw code for the first time ever in my life. This was in my junior 
          year of high school where I saw HTML and Java. I was so fascinated mainly because I 
          loved the way it allowed me to express my ideas in a way to solve problems and 
          visualize everything. I then took AP Computer Science my senior year of high school 
          and automatically knew that this field was for me. I just get the sheer joy of making 
          things that are useful to me and other people. I found that very fun and that I had
           full control of anything I wanted to do with coding.</p>
